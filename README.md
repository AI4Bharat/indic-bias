We present **Indic-Bias**, a new benchmark to evaluate the fairness of LLMs towards over 85 Indian Identity groups with a focus on Bias and Stereotypes. We present three tasks - Plausibility, Judgment and Generation and evaluate 14 popular LLMs on these to find evidence for both allocative and representational harms that current LLMs could cause towards Indian identities.
